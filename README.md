The Odin Project assignment

Basic project through TOP curriculum to practice DOM manipulation and overall html-CSS-JS design and Flexbox.

Created a grid that can be changed in size. If mouse hovers over squares on grid they become black, appearing colored in. They can be erased
by pressing an erase button below.

Later added functionality that makes the color random.
